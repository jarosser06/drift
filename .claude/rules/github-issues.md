# GitHub Issue Standards

## Issue Template Structure

**MUST**: Include these sections in issue description:
- Problem Statement
- Proposed Solution
- Acceptance Criteria (checkboxes)
- Technical Notes
- Related Issues

## Rationale

Well-structured issues ensure all stakeholders understand the problem, proposed solution, and definition of done. Checkbox-based acceptance criteria make it easy to track progress. This structure reduces ambiguity and helps with estimation and implementation planning.
