# Git Branch Naming Standards

## Branch Naming Convention

**MUST**: Use format: `issue-<number>-<short-description>`

**MUST**: All lowercase

**MUST**: Hyphen separated

**MUST**: Descriptive but concise

**MUST**: Always reference issue number

## Rationale

Consistent branch naming makes it easy to identify the purpose of a branch and link it to the corresponding issue. This convention improves traceability and helps with automated tooling and CI/CD workflows.
