# Python Type Hint Requirements

**MUST**: All public functions have type hints for parameters and return values.

## Rationale

Type hints improve code documentation, enable static type checking with mypy, and help catch bugs before runtime. They serve as inline documentation for function interfaces and improve IDE autocomplete functionality.
