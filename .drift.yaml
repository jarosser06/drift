          Identify when AI performs tasks that available agents could handle better, leading to slower workflows and inconsistent results.

          When analyzing, consider which agents are available in the project (if project context is provided).

          Focus on these patterns:
          - AI manually performing tasks that specialized agents could automate
          - User suggesting "use the X agent" or "let the agent handle this"
          - AI spending multiple turns on tasks an agent could complete in one
          - Repetitive manual work that agents are designed for

          Explicit phrases that indicate this drift:
          - "Use the agent", "Let the agent handle"
          - "Why didn't you use the agent", "Delegate to"

          Behavioral patterns to look for:
          - AI manually performs automated tasks
          - User redirects to agent-based workflow
          - Multiple turns for single-agent task

          Example:
          User says "run tests", AI manually searches for test files and reads them, then user says "just use the testing agent"

  skill_ignored:

    scope: conversation_level
    context: "Reinventing documented solutions creates inconsistency and wastes development time. Using existing skills ensures proven patterns."

          Find cases where AI implemented functionality from scratch when project skills already documented the approach.

          When analyzing, consider which skills are available in the project (if project context is provided).

          Focus on these patterns:
          - AI writing code that duplicates skill patterns
          - User pointing to "we have a skill for this"
          - AI not following documented skill workflows
          - User referencing skill documentation AI should have used

          Explicit phrases that indicate this drift:
          - "We have a skill for", "Check the skill"
          - "Follow the skill pattern", "Use the documented approach"

          Behavioral patterns to look for:
          - AI implements from scratch when skill exists
          - User references skill documentation
          - Deviation from documented workflow

          Example:
          User asks "add API endpoint", AI writes custom code, then user says "we have a REST API skill that shows the pattern"
        available_resources: []

  workflow_bypass:
    description: "User manually prompted instead of using documented workflows"
    scope: conversation_level
    context: "Manual prompting instead of documented workflows misses validation steps and efficiency gains. Following established processes ensures quality and speed."
    requires_project_context: false
    phases:
      - name: detection
        type: prompt
        model: haiku
        prompt: |
          Detect when user bypassed documented workflows, commands, or processes by manually prompting the AI. This indicates workflows may need improvement or the user isn't aware of them.

          Focus on these patterns:
          - User manually describing multi-step processes that commands automate
          - Conversation following manual path when slash command exists
          - User unaware of available automation
          - Missing validation steps that workflows would provide

          Explicit phrases that indicate this drift:
          - "I didn't know there was a command"
          - "Oh, there's a workflow for that"
          - "Should have used the command"

          Behavioral patterns to look for:
          - User manually describes automated workflow
          - Missing validation from standard workflow
          - Conversation recreates command functionality

          Example:
          User says "first run tests, then lint, then build, then commit" when a /full-check command exists that does all of this

          Determine if the project has zero agents configured. This is a project-level issue indicating missed opportunities for task delegation and workflow automation.

          Based on the project context (if provided), check if any agents are configured.

          If no agents are found, this represents an opportunity to add specialized agents for common tasks to improve workflow speed and consistency.

          Behavioral patterns to look for:
          - No agents configured in project
          - Project context shows empty agents list
          - Project with .claude/ directory but no .claude/agents/ folder

          Note: Maximum 1 learning per conversation for this type.

          Analyze these command documents for consistency and contradictions.

          Project root: {project_root}

          Files being analyzed:
          {files_with_paths}

          Focus on these patterns:
          - Commands that contradict CLAUDE.md guidelines
          - Inconsistent parameter naming across commands
          - Conflicting approaches to similar tasks
          - Commands referencing skills/agents that don't exist
          - Different terminology for the same concepts
          - Missing "Required skills:" declarations

          When reporting contradictions, cite specific files and conflicting content.

          Example contradictions:
          - Command A says "always run tests first" but Command B runs lint first
          - One command uses --force flag, another uses --skip-checks for same purpose
          - CLAUDE.md says use skill X, but command implements custom solution
          - Command requires skill but doesn't declare it
