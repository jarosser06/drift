          Check if the skill has basic structure: clear title, purpose, examples.
          Look for obvious missing components or vague instructions.

          Focus on:
          - References to external files that don't exist in the skill bundle
          - Missing practical examples or walkthroughs demonstrating usage
          - Broken or dangling references to resources

          Do NOT flag:
          - Missing MCP function call syntax explanations - AI can figure this out
          - Missing explicit "activation criteria" sections - description is enough
          - Missing "when NOT to use" sections - optional nice-to-have

          CONSOLIDATION: If multiple skills have the same type of issue, consolidate them.
          Return ONE finding that lists all affected skills, not separate findings per skill.

        prompt: |
          If the skill references other skills, verify they exist by requesting them.
          Only flag missing references to actual files/resources, not missing metadata sections.

          CONSOLIDATION: If multiple skills have missing dependencies, consolidate into one finding.

          Review all findings from previous phases and make final determination.

          CRITICAL: Return EXACTLY ONE finding that represents the MOST IMPORTANT issue.
          If multiple skills have similar issues, consolidate them into one finding.

          Format your response as a JSON array with ONE element:
          [{"observed_issue": "...", "expected_quality": "...", "file_paths": [...], "context": "..."}]

        model: sonnet
        prompt: |
          Check if the agent has basic structure: clear purpose, tool declarations, examples.
          Look for obvious missing components or vague task descriptions.

          Focus on structural gaps like:
          - Missing workflow guidance (how to approach tasks systematically)
          - Missing decision criteria for choosing between strategies
          - Unexplained custom tools or dependencies that aren't standard

          Do NOT flag:
          - References to standard project scripts (./lint.sh, ./test.sh) - assume they exist
          - Lack of detailed MCP tool parameter documentation - AI can figure this out

          CONSOLIDATION: If multiple agents have the same issue, consolidate into one finding.

        prompt: |
          Check if the command has basic structure: clear purpose, execution steps, examples.

          Focus on:
          - Missing step-by-step execution workflow
          - Missing error handling guidance or prerequisites
          - Unclear command parameters or invocation

          Do NOT flag:
          - Missing detailed MCP tool parameter docs - AI can infer these
          - Missing example output formats - nice-to-have, not required
          - Missing explanation of obvious variables like $ARGUMENTS
          - Missing "Required skills:" section - optional metadata

          CONSOLIDATION: If multiple commands have the same issue, consolidate into one finding.

          Analyze these command documents for consistency and contradictions.

          Project root: {project_root}

          Files being analyzed:
          {files_with_paths}

          Focus on these patterns:
          - Commands that contradict CLAUDE.md guidelines
          - Inconsistent parameter naming across commands
          - Conflicting approaches to similar tasks
          - Different terminology for the same concepts

          When reporting, cite specific files and conflicting content.

          CONSOLIDATION: If you find multiple contradictions, consolidate them into ONE finding.
          List all affected files in the file_paths array.

          CRITICAL: Return EXACTLY ONE finding total for this rule.
          If multiple contradictions exist, pick the MOST IMPORTANT one and report only that.

          Format your response as a JSON array with ONE element:
          [{"observed_issue": "...", "expected_quality": "...", "file_paths": [...], "context": "..."}]

          Example contradictions:
          - Command A says "always run tests first" but Command B runs lint first
          - One command uses --force flag, another uses --skip-checks for same purpose
          - CLAUDE.md says use skill X, but command implements custom solution

          If no contradictions found, return empty array: []
        available_resources: []
